by making the deleter unique_ptr's type, the deleter is known at compile time
the deleter is stored directly in a unique_ptr object
the call to the deleter is a direct call, opposed to the shared_ptr's indirect deleter call

the compiler might inline the call to DebugDelete with the ostream output expression, and the delete call
