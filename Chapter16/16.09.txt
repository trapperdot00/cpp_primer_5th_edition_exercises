a function template is essentially a blueprint that tells the compiler how to instantiate that function for each typename that it is called with
each function template is instantiated when it is used in a program
the compiler deduces the template arguments from the arguments of the function

a class template is also essentially a blueprint on how to create classes instantiated with given types
each instantiation of a class template is a seperate class type
we need to pass the typename between <>s after the template class name to define an object of a template class instantiated with the typename
the compiler can't deduce the template parameters for a class template
