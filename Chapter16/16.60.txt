make_shared works similarly as emplace_back
it constructs a new element on the heap/dynamically, and returns a shared_ptr pointing to it

make_shared is a variadic template function, takes any number of arguments of any type
since the compiler can not deduce the type of the element we are constructing, we need to provide an explicit template argument list for the type to construct
the function calls that type's constructor, forwarding all of our arguments with std::forward, to preserve the arguments' original types
after the construction is done, it calls shared_ptr's constructor, that takes a raw pointer, and returns that shared_ptr to the call location
that shared_ptr's use_count is set initially to 1
