if we were to call print(os, 1, 2, 3, 4), and our nonvariadic version of print
 was declared after the variadic version's definition:

1:	print(os, 1, 2, 3, 4)
	t is 1,
	rest is 2, 3, 4

2:	print(os, 2, 3, 4)
	t is 2
	rest is 3, 4

3:	print(os, 3, 4)
	t is 3
	rest is 4

4:	print(os, 4)
	t is 4
	rest is empty

5:	print(os)	-> error, no argument for t!
