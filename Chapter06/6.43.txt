a)
inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}

// this goes into a header file, because definitions of constexpr and inline functions must match exactly.
// constexpr and inline functions get expanded into the program line

b)
void putValues(int *arr, int size);

// this also goes into a header file: it is a declaration, not a definition
// definition goes into a source file
