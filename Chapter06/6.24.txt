void print(const int ia[10])
{
	for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++1)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
}

// the compiler doesn't care about the dimension of the array in the function's parameter list, sees it as int *ia
// this enables all kinds of pointers to const int to be able to call this function, not caring about it's sizes
fix 1:

void print(const int ia[10], size_t size) {
	for (size_t i = 0; i != size; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
}

// in this fix we will trust the user that they input the correct size for their arrays

fix 2:

void print(const int (&ia)[10]) {
	for (const int &i : ia)
		cout << i << endl;
}

// this is even better: can only call function on an array of size 10
