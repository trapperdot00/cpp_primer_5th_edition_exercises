parameter:
	a local variable initialized with arguments when calling the function
	initialized when execution passes through, each call
	its value depends on the inputted arguments, controllable from the outside
	destroyed when function ends
	
	for example a function that returns the absolute value of the inputted argument

local variable:
	a variable defined inside a function, that is local to that function
	its value may always be the same, uncontrollable from the outside
	hide declarations of the same name made in the outer scope
	initialized when execution passes through, each call
	destroyed when function ends

	for example the return value inside the absolute value function

local static variable:
	a variable defined inside a function whose lifetime continues across calls to the function
	initialized only once, before the first time execution passes through its definition
	destroyed when the program terminates

	for example a value that counts how many times this function has been called
