using declarations make only one member of a namespace visible,
it can appear in global, local, namespace or class scope (only to refer to base class members)
declares a local alias for the selected namespace member
immediately throws an error if there is a name clash

using directives make all members of a namespace visible
it can appear in global, local or namespace scope
lifts the namespace members in the nearest scope that contains both the namespace and the using directive
if there is a name clash, throws error when trying to use the clashing name, not immediately
