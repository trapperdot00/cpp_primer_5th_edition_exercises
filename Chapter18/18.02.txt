// if exception were to happen at the indicated location,
// the dynamic memory pointed to by p would be lost, as
// the compiler does no work to destroy built-in types
// the vector's and ifstream's destructors however would
// be ran, because destructors of class types are called
// when exiting a function due to an exception throw
