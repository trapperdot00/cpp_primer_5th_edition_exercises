a static class member is a member that is not tied to an object of class type
objects of class type don't contain the data associated with static members, they are associated with the type
static member functions don't have a this pointer in their parameter lists -> they can't be declared const
static data members can have an incomplete type, such as the same class it is in, not just as a pointer to it, or reference
static members exist until the program completes
we can use static members as default arguments in parameter lists inside member functions
