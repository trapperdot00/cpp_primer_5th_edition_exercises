string and vector both define an overloaded ==
svec1, svec2 are vector<string> objects

a)
	"cobble" == "stone"			// uses the overloaded operator== that takes two strings
b)
	svec1[0] == svec2[0]		// subscripting a vector returns the underlying type, so the string version is used
c)
	svec1 == svec2				// uses the operator== that takes two vectors
d)
	svec1[0] == "stone"			// uses the string overloaded == operator
