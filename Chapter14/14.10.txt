Describe the behavior of the Sales_data input operator if given the following inputs:

a)
0-201-99999-9 10 24.95

// declare a double, named price
// read into the Sales_data item's bookNo, then into its units_sold, then into the declared price
// the condition that checks whether the istream object is in a valid state returns true, the Sales_data item's revenue member is
// assigned the product of the item's units_sold member and the price
// the overload for operator>> function returns the valid istream object

b)
10 24.95 0-210-99999-9

// declare a double, named price
// read into the Sales_data item's bookNo member, passes
// read into the item's units_sold member, that is unsigned, passes, the istream object is still in a valid state, inputted floating point number truncated
// read into price, the double, but encounters an invalid character, istream is now in an invalid state
// the condition that checks the istream object's state returns false, item is assigned a default initialized Sales_data object to leave the object in a valid state
