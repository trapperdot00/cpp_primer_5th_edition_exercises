explain how to decide whether the following operators should be class members:

a)
	operator%
	// should be a nonmember function: symmetric operator that might convert either operand
b)
	operator%=
	// should be a member, changes object's value
c)
	operator++
	// should be a member, as it changes the state of their objects
d)
	operator->
	// must be defined as a class-member
e)
	operator<<
	// should be a nonmember function: symmetric operator, that might convert either operand
f)
	operator&&
	// SHOULDN'T BE OVERLOADED, but if neccesary for unknown reasons, then it should be a nonmember
g)
	operator==
	// should be a nonmember: symmetric operator that might convert either operand
h)
	operator()
	// must be class-member
