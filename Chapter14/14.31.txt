the StrBlobPtr class doesn't define the copy constructor, the assignment operator, and the destructor, and that is okay, because the compiler sythesizes a correct one for our class. since we use smart pointers to use dynamic memory instead of using raw pointers, we don't need to go out of our way to manage memory, instead the smart pointers manage when to destroy the allocated data.
