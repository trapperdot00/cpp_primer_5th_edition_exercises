what, if anything is wrong with the following Sales_data input operator?
what would happen if we gave this operator the data in the previous exercise?

istream& operator>>(istream& in, Sales_data& s)
{
	double price;
	in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
	s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
	return in;
}


// if we gave invalid values into the input operator, price would be left undefined, and there is an operation using price's value
// we have to check if the read succeeded
