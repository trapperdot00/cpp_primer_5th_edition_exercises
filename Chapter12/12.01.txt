StrBlob b1;
{
	StrBlob b2 = {"a", "an", "the"};
	b1 = b2;
	b2.push_back("about");
}

how many elements do b1 and b2 have 
here
^

// b1.size() is 4, because b2 and b1 used a shared_ptr, both managed the same vector<string>
// b2 doesn't exist anymore, but b1 does, and the shared_ptr<vector<string>> is still alive, has one user: b1
