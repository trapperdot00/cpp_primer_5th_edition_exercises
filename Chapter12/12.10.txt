void process(shared_ptr<int> p) {
	// use p
}

shared_ptr<int> p(new int(42));
process(shared_ptr<int>(p.get()));

// error: temporary shared_ptr is destroyed after the call to process, destroys p's value, after calling delete on the pointed data, if p is destroyed, the data is destroyed twice, which is undefined

fix:

process(p);
or 
process(shared_ptr<int>(p));
