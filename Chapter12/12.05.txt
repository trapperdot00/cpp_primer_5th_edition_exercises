not making the StrBlob constructor that takes an initializer_list<string> explicit

pros:
	can call functions that take an StrBlob with an initializer_list<string>
	compiler will use initializer_list<string> in an automatic conversion to StrBlob
	can use the copy form of initialization ( StrBlob s = {"asdasds", "asdad"}; )

cons:
	harder to debug if there are any errors
	overloaded functions could implicitly convert initializer_list<string> to StrBlob
