Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined
to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off
between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by
the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

i think it is acceptable, you have to learn the language to be a good programmer
