iter is a vector<string>::iterator

*iter++;
// legal: increments iter and dereferences the unincremented value (previous)

(*iter)++;
// illegal: dereferences iter then tries to increment the string it is pointing to, but you can't increment a string by one

*iter.empty();
// illegal: tries to call empty member on the iterator

iter->empty();
// legal: dereferences iter and calls the empty member on the string

++*iter;
// illegal: dereferences iter and tries to increment the string

iter++->empty();
// legal: increments iter, and calls the empty member on the unincremented iter's string that it points to
