overflow is when you reach the maximum value a variable can hold, and try to force a bigger value into it than it can hold. it is undefined behaviour

char c = 101010101011044
short s = 7282748392748
int i = 292829292929292929292

unsigned integers have defined overflow values, they wrap around, meaning if you try to decrement 0 as an unsigned, you get the maximum value
