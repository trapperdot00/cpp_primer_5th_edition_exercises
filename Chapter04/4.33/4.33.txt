someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y

(someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x), --y

what the sigma

// if someValue is true, increments x by one, and y by one, but decrements y by one after the conditional, because it is not in its else branch
// if it is false, decrements both x and y by one, the '--y' gets evaluated regardless of the trueness of someValue
// returns y after the decrement
