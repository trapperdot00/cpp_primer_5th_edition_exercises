char cval;
int ival;
unsigned int ui;
float fval;
double dval;

cval = 'a' + 3;
// 'a' character literal is promoted to int for the addition, the sum is converted to char

fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
// ival is converted to double for the multiplication, ui is converted to double, the right-hand value after all operations that has type double, converts to float in the assignment

dval = ui * fval;
// ui converts to float for the multiplication, product converts to double for the assignment

cval = ival + fval + dval;
// ival converts to float, sum converts to double, right-hand side converts to char for the assignment
