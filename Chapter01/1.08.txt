indicate which statements are legal

std::cout << "/*";					// perfectly legal output statement

std::cout << "*/";					// still legal

std::cout << /* "*/" */;			// illegal: multiline comment comments out the first string delimiter, only the second is seen
// what the compiler sees of the code:
	std::cout << ";

std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;	// legal but why would you do this
// what the compiler sees:
	std::cout << " /* ";
