I liked the version I wrote for exercise 17.6 the best, because it doesn't need a constant expression
to index the contained elements like in an std::tuple, and it didn't need such ugly code as in
the nested std::pairs
I like the fact that I can easily make a class type for this specific use case, and I can tune its
interface to my liking

I think std::tuple is still passable, as it is a standard library container, they surely know what they
were doing
