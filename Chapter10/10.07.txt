a)
vector<int> vec;
list<int> lst;
int i;
while (cin >> i)
	lst.push_back(i);
copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), vec.begin());	// error: vector doesn't have at least as many elements as the list

fix:

copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), back_inserter(vec));	// inserts list's contents to the back of the vector instead of trying to overwrite the nonexistent element of the vector

b)
vector<int> vec;
vec.reserve(10);
fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0);	// error: vector doesn't have at least 10 element, only reserved 10 elements

fix:

fill_n(back_inserter(vec), 10, 0);
