# Chapter10: Generic Algorithms
## [Exercise 10.1](10.01.cpp)
The algorithm header defines a function named count that, like
find, takes a pair of iterators and a value. count returns a count of how often that
value appears. Read a sequence of ints into a vector and print the count of how
many elements have a given value.
## [Exercise 10.2](10.02.cpp)
Repeat the previous program, but read values into a list of strings.
## [Exercise 10.3](10.03.cpp)
Use accumulate to sum the elements in a vector<int>.
## [Exercise 10.4](10.04.cpp)
Assuming v is a vector<double>, what, if anything, is wrong with
calling accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0)?
## [Exercise 10.5](10.05.cpp)
In the call to equal on rosters, what would happen if both rosters held
C-style strings, rather than library strings?
## [Exercise 10.6](10.06.cpp)
Using fill_n, write a program to set a sequence of int values to 0.
## [Exercise 10.7](10.07.txt)
Determine if there are any errors in the following programs and, if so,
correct the error(s):
```
(a) vector<int> vec; list<int> lst; int i;
    while (cin >> i)
        lst.push_back(i);
    copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), vec.begin());
(b) vector<int> vec;
    vec.reserve(10); // reserve is covered in § 9.4 (p. 356)
    fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0);
```
## [Exercise 10.8](10.08.txt)
We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over
which they operate. Why doesn’t the use of back_inserter invalidate this claim?
## [Exercise 10.9](10.09.cpp)
Implement your own version of elimDups. Test your program by
printing the vector after you read the input, after the call to unique, and after the
call to erase.
## [Exercise 10.10](10.10.txt)
Why do you think the algorithms don’t change the size of containers?
## [Exercise 10.11](10.11.cpp)
Write a program that uses stable_sort and isShorter to sort a
vector passed to your version of elimDups. Print the vector to verify that your
program is correct.
## [Exercise 10.12](10.12)
Write a function named compareIsbn that compares the isbn()
members of two Sales_data objects. Use that function to sort a vector that holds
Sales_data objects.
## [Exercise 10.13](10.13.cpp)
The library defines an algorithm named partition that takes a pred-
icate and partitions the container so that values for which the predicate is true appear
in the first part and those for which the predicate is false appear in the second part.
The algorithm returns an iterator just past the last element for which the predicate
returned true. Write a function that takes a string and returns a bool indicating
whether the string has five characters or more. Use that function to partition words.
Print the elements that have five or more characters.
## [Exercise 10.14](10.14.cpp)
Write a lambda that takes two ints and returns their sum.
## [Exercise 10.15](10.15.cpp)
Write a lambda that captures an int from its enclosing function and
takes an int parameter. The lambda should return the sum of the captured int and
the int parameter.
## [Exercise 10.16](10.16.cpp)
Write your own version of the biggies function using lambdas.
## [Exercise 10.17](10.17)
Rewrite exercise 10.12 from § 10.3.1 (p. 387) to use a lambda in the call
to sort instead of the compareIsbn function.
## [Exercise 10.18](10.18.cpp)
Rewrite biggies to use partition instead of find_if. We de-
scribed the partition algorithm in exercise 10.13 in § 10.3.1 (p. 387).
## [Exercise 10.19](10.19.cpp)
Rewrite the previous exercise to use stable_partition, which like
stable_sort maintains the original element order in the paritioned sequence.
## [Exercise 10.20](10.20.cpp)
The library defines an algorithm named count_if. Like find_if,
this function takes a pair of iterators denoting an input range and a predicate that it
applies to each element in the given range. count_if returns a count of how often the
predicate is true. Use count_if to rewrite the portion of our program that counted
how many words are greater than length 6.
## [Exercise 10.21](10.21.cpp)
Write a lambda that captures a local int variable and decrements that
variable until it reaches 0. Once the variable is 0 additional calls should no longer
decrement the variable. The lambda should return a bool that indicates whether the
captured variable is 0.
## [Exercise 10.22](10.22.cpp)
Rewrite the program to count words of size 6 or less using functions
in place of the lambdas.
## [Exercise 10.23](10.23.txt)
How many arguments does bind take?
## [Exercise 10.24](10.24.cpp)
Use bind and check_size to find the first element in a vector of
ints that has a value greater than the length of a specified string value.
## [Exercise 10.25](10.25.cpp)
In the exercises for § 10.3.2 (p. 392) you wrote a version of biggies
that uses partition. Rewrite that function to use check_size and bind.
## [Exercise 10.26](10.26.txt)
Explain the differences among the three kinds of insert iterators.
## [Exercise 10.27](10.27.cpp)
In addition to unique (§ 10.2.3, p. 384), the library defines function
named unique_copy that takes a third iterator denoting a destination into which
to copy the unique elements. Write a program that uses unique_copy to copy the
unique elements from a vector into an initially empty list.
## [Exercise 10.28](10.28.cpp)
Copy a vector that holds the values from 1 to 9 inclusive, into three
other containers. Use an inserter, a back_inserter, and a front_inserter,
respectivly to add elements to these containers. Predict how the output sequence varies
by the kind of inserter and verify your predictions by running your programs.
## [Exercise 10.29](10.29.cpp)
Write a program using stream iterators to read a text file into a vector of strings.
## [Exercise 10.30](10.30.cpp)
Use stream iterators, sort, and copy to read a sequence of integers
from the standard input, sort them, and then write them back to the standard output.
## [Exercise 10.31](10.31.cpp)
Update the program from the previous exercise so that it prints only
the unique elements. Your program should use unqiue_copy (§ 10.4.1, p. 403).
## [Exercise 10.32](10.32)
Rewrite the bookstore problem from § 1.6 (p. 24) using a vector to
hold the transactions and various algorithms to do the processing. Use sort with
your compareIsbn function from § 10.3.1 (p. 387) to arrange the transactions in order,
and then use find and accumulate to do the sum.
## [Exercise 10.33](10.33.cpp)
Write a program that takes the names of an input file and two output
files. The input file should hold integers. Using an istream_iterator read the
input file. Using ostream_iterators, write the odd numbers into the first output
file. Each value should be followed by a space. Write the even numbers into the second
file. Each of these values should be placed on a separate line.
## [Exercise 10.34](10.34.cpp)
Use reverse_iterators to print a vector in reverse order.
## [Exercise 10.35](10.35.cpp)
Now print the elements in reverse order using ordinary iterators.
## [Exercise 10.36](10.36.cpp)
Use find to find the last element in a list of ints with value 0.
## [Exercise 10.37](10.37.cpp)
Given a vector that has ten elements, copy the elements from posi-
tions 3 through 7 in reverse order to a list.
## [Exercise 10.38](10.38.txt)
List the five iterator categories and the operations that each supports.
## [Exercise 10.39](10.39.txt)
What kind of iterator does a list have? What about a vector?
## [Exercise 10.40](10.40.txt)
What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires? What about
reverse or unique?
## [Exercise 10.41](10.41.txt)
Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe the oper-
ation that the each of the following library algorithms performs:
```
replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val);
replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val);
replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);
replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val);
```
## [Exercise 10.42](10.42.cpp)
Reimplement the program that eliminated duplicate words that we
wrote in § 10.2.3 (p. 383) to use a list instead of a vector.
