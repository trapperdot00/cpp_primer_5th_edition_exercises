we defined a default constructor for Disc_quote, because otherwise it would only have the constructor that takes a string, a double, a size_t and another double
explicitly defining one constructor prevents the compiler from synthesizing one from us, so we have to explicitly ask it to generate one for us
removing the default constructor would prevent Bulk_quote from defining a default constructor, as it would try to default initialize the Disc_quote subpart using Disc_quote's default constructor which is deleted
