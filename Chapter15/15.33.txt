Query_base also relies on the compiler synthesized copy control members, but it doesn't have any data members, it is an abstract class
The synthesized copy control members ensure that the derived classes' synthesized copy control members can call their base class' copy control members
Query_base declares its destructor as a virtual function that can be overridden by the derived classes, but relies on the compiler to generate a definition for it
