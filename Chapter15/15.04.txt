class Base { ... };

a)
class Derived : public Derived { ... };
// error: base class must be defined before inheriting from it,
// therefore we can't derive a class from itself

b)
class Derived : private Base { ... };
// legal

c)
class Derived : public Base;
// error: derivation list can't appear inside a class declaration
