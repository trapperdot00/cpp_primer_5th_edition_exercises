if we didn't define a destructor for HasPtr, we would have gotten a memory leak: the constructors allocate a string on the heap that the compiler synthesized destructor won't delete for us

if we didn't define a copy constructor for HasPtr, the compiler synthesized copy constructor would copy the pointer instead of dynamically allocating a new string for the pointer, thus we would get pointerlike behavior
