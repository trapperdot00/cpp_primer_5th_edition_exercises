we used the postfix increment in construct's call inside push_back because we could have written into unallocated memory if we used the prefix version of it

consider:

size = 3
capacity = 4

|	 |	|	 |	|	 |	 |	 |	  |			|
|----|	|----|	|----|	 |	 |----|			|
						 |					|

elements					 first_free		cap

in our postfix increment version, the correct element denoted by first_free is constructed
if we used the prefix increment version, we would have missed one element and would have written into unallocated memory
