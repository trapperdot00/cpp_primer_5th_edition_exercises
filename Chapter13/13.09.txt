a destructor is a function that is run when
	the class type goes out of scope
	when the object of which they are a part of is destroyed
	when they are element(s) in a container, and the container is destroyed
	when dynamically allocated objects are deleted with a pointer to them
	when temporary objects reach the end of the full expression they are created in, and they are destroyed

the synthesized destructor is a compiler generated desctructor function that destroys all nonstatic data members, but it doesn't destroy dynamically allocated objects
the nonstatic members are destroyed after the destructor body is executed, in reverse order from which they are initialized
a destructor is synthesized when we omit the definition of one
