the copy-assignment operator is the = operator
it is used when assigning to a class type object from another object of the same type

the synthetised copy-assignment operator assigns each static data member of the right-hand object to the left-hand object, with the = operator for each member
the copy-assignment operand is synthesized when we omit its definition
