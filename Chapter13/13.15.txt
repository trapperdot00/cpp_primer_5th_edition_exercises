if numbered had a copy constructor that generates a unique serial number for the constructed object, then the output would be three non-identical number, because the synthesized copy-constructor copies all data members into the other, with our copy constructor, we could fine tune what to copy and what else to do inside the constructor

our output won't be our three inputted objects' serial numbers, because the function takes a nonreference numbered object, which generates its own serial number for each call
