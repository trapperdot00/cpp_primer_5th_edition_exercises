We don't need to define our own copy-control members for the TextQuery and QueryResult classes, since we need to copy all of the members when we copy construct an element, we need to assign all members from the other when we assign using the copy-assignment operator, and we need to delete all objects when destroying an object of these types using their destructors.

The synthesized copy-control members are sufficient for us.
