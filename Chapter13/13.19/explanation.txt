We need to supply our own copy-control members, because the compiler wrongly synthesizes them to copy the ids from the other object.
We need to specify to only copy the employee's name from the other object, if we want unique ids for each employee.

It doesn't need a destructor since we don't allocate data members on the heap inside the class, that the compiler wouldn't delete. All data members use stack memory.
