the copy constructor is a constructor that has parameter which is a reference (to usually const) to the current class' type, and if there are other parameters, they must have default values
the copy constructor is used usually when copy initialization occurs, and when directly initializing a class object with another object in the arguments to the constructor

it is used generally when
	defining variables with =
	passing an object as an argument to a parameter of nonreference type
	returning an object from a function that has a nonreference type
	brace initializing elements of an array or aggregate classes
