an rvalue reference can only be bound to an object that is bound to be destroyed, aka an rvalue
	we can obtain an rvalue from an lvalue (such as a variable) using std::move(), defined in the utility header. after calling move on an lvalue, we can't use its value
	we know that the referred to object is about to be destroyed and that there can't be any other users of that object

an lvalue reference can only be bound to an lvalue (such as a variable), that has a persistent state
	constant lvalue references can be bound to rvalues
